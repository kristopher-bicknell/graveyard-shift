## Game Concept

## Features

- **Work as a gas station attendant.** You will be selling snacks, drinks, cigarettes, alcohol, gas, and lottery tickets to people who, for whatever reason, still feel it necessary to interface with the local 6-Ten during the literal end of the world.
- **Get paid.** Due to the current unprecedented times, your boss is unable to provide you with the stable wages you were once used to. However, he's cut you a deal: you get a cut of every sale you make, fifty-fifty. We just can't guarantee sales at this time, so this is the best we can do, right?
- **Stay alive.** In an attempt to preserve staff, your boss has given you free reign to defend your post by any means necessary. If you think a customer may be infected, do not hesitate. It is your duty. Just try to clean up after.
